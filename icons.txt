ICON FILES NEEDED FOR CHROME EXTENSION
========================================

The manifest.json references these icon files that you'll need to add:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

QUICK SOLUTION:
You can create simple placeholder icons by:
1. Creating 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixel PNG files
2. Use any image editor or online tool
3. Suggested design: A key icon (üîê) or lock symbol

ALTERNATIVE:
1. Remove the "icons" section from manifest.json if you don't want custom icons
2. Chrome will use default extension icons

ICON RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use a key, lock, or security-related symbol
- Colors: Blue, purple, or green to match the UI theme
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

The extension will work without custom icons, but they improve the user experience.
